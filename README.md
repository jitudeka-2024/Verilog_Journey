# Verilog_Journey
Welcome to my Verilog HDL learning repository. This is a step-by-step documentation of my digital design journey using Verilog — starting from basic gates to building an ALU and beyond.


## Why This Repo?

I created this to:
- Track my own learning progress
- Practice structured project organization
